    "paragraph": "I am a first-generation college graduate, of mixed ancestry including AAPI and Native Hawaiian descent. Whether it's making my own desk, assembling my self-fabricated metal parts to build something else, or building things with code - I’m a tinkerer and self-starter who loves making things. I love reading, and am currently brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms. I am pursuing a career in tech to follow a longstanding passion for creativity and technology, and generally to just make great things.",
